Exercise 10.1

Revise a previous program as follows: Read and parse the “From”
lines and pull out the addresses from the line. Count the number of messages from
each person using a dictionary.

After all the data has been read print the person with the most commits by creating
a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary and then sorting the list in reverse
order and print out the person who has the most commits.
